# `electron`

This is where the code for the electron app lives. We are using React with TypeScript for front end, and electron for creating the window.

- .env has a flag to ignore the checks that occur before `npm run start`
- See top level readme for instructions on how to install and run the app
- App will be started alongside the server from root directory
- `public` directory contains base electron function that creates window
- `src` contains all `.tsx` files, and related `test.tsx` and `css` files


TODO:
- Add a prettier config for React and Typescript to this `electron` package.
