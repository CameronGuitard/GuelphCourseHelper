### ***Graduate Student Feedback***

-icon and button text colours should be opposite of button background colour(ex. black button and white text)\
-increase font size for the buttons\
-smaller icons for better spacing\
-should have light background and dark foreground or vice-versa\
-choosing colours on opposite sides of the colour spectrum \
-make each button a different colour in general when selected or not selected (EX. overview is red, lookup is purple etc)\
-background colours should not capture attention more than the foreground, which the dark background is in this case\
-if all colours are random and vibrant, your eyes wont know where to look first\
-try to use colours that are the same but different shades and gradients (light orange for the button background color and dark orange for the div that the button sits on)\
-round the corners of the box as opposed to just leaving the corners
